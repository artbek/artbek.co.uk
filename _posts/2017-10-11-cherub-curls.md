Anna-Banana, fair skin, cherub curls.  
In the whole world there are no better girls.  

To hear your voice on the phone I will miss.  
Live through the dramas with you was a bliss.  

You're one of a kind, great mind, gentle heart,  
great sense of humour, nearly work of art.  

It's time for goodbye... it makes me cry...  
Godspeed, Beautiful Angel, wherever you may fly.
