It is today, that  
for two little girls   
time will flick another page   
on the calendar of age.  

Everything springs to life  
no longer trapped in the winter's cage  
what a fine mid-April day  
to relax, celebrate, and play.  

So please accept, what  
i'm sending your way:  
just a few friendly kisses  
jam-packed with birthday wishes.
