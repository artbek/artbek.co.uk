soggy fur, sappy eyes,  
a defeated puppy  
wandering through the dark  
woods, lonely, unhappy  

tired, sat on a stone  
frozen to the marrow  
out of nowhere...  
a song of a happy sparrow  

but it wasn't a bird,  
'twas strange orange contraption  
that kept ringing, and ringing  
with force of attraction  

he picked up,  
and i think you know  
how this story ends...  

Be happy my Angels you've been wonderful friends!!
