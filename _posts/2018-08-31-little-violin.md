backstory: "Another farewell card. Here's some references explained. Her voice had an interesting violin-like texture to it (hence the nickname). She has Russian roots, and is an amazing chef - I have used her recipies. She actually has moved on to follow her dream - running a coffee house."

One cold morning I felt an urge to bake  
Well, why don't I try a banana cake?  
  
Easier said than done,  
I have never made one.  
  
Let's try classifieds... there's one with a stylish pin  
spelled in Cyrillic: LITTLE VIOLIN.  
  
So I called, trembling, with confidence all fluffy,  
but she was a cuteheart, sweeter than a puppy.  
  
I got a recipe that looked simple but be not mistaken:  
she knows much more about baking than how to rock an apron!  
  
I tried it and went to heaven...  

HEAVEN TIMES ELEVEN !! !! !!  
  
And if you think I'm joking, trying to make you laugh,  
just visit her caf√©, and ask one of the staff.
