backstory: "For a girl who wanted to spend her birthday at Ascot Racecourse, but couldn't find her fascinator. Also, because she could sing and there's a sea creature in her full name I used to called her 'Little Mermaid'."
title: "Percolator"
date: "2018-08-14"

"Oh no, a disaster,  
I've lost my fascinator?!  
What will I wear,  
hmm... I need my percolator."  
One little sip - a brainwave  
 hit straight away,  
and she knew exactly how to  
dress for this special day.  
  
Forget the mermaid who hides behind the calculator:  
SHE TOOK BREATH AWAY OF EVERY LIVING ALLIGATOR!!
