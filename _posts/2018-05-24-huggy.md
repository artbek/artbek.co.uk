In the foggy city of Rosy Lee,  
lives a wonderful girl called Emi-Ly,  
abundantly kind, pretty, and funny,  
and always, always, a hard-working bunny.  

Proficient at handling a project, or a couple,  
even three seem a doddle - such a peach and so supple.  

Make sure this day is all but sugar-free,  
'cause it's today she's turning 23!!
