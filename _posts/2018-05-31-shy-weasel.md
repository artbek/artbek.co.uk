backstory: "I like weasels. I think they're intelligent, playful, and feminine. I met a girl who was all those things. It's funny now, but she wasn't impressed when I called her \"weasel\" for the first time."

There was a shy weasel called Hannah,  
soooo tempted to nick a sultana.  
You might think good grief,  
but she's not a thief.  
She needs it for bread for her Nana.
