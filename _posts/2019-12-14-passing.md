title: "Passing"

Heavy drops lumber down the window pane.  
His face terrified of days about to end.  
Sun, although blind, heard the rolling pain  
and rays of mending light decided to send.  
  
Crafty photons\.\.\. each one like a spear  
injected every tear with a vibrant breeze,  
the rain of sadness began to disappear  
giving way to rainbows of good memories.  
  
Good old Frost, although deaf in one ear,  
heard and has frozen the colour in the skies,  
which makes Old Year happy to pass without fear,  
to close his tired eyes and dream of lows and highs.
